# Competitive Programming and Contests

* Teacher: [Rossano Venturini](http://pages.di.unipi.it/rossano)
* Teaching assistant: [Giulio Ermanno Pibiri](http://pages.di.unipi.it/pibiri)
* CFU: 6
* Period: First semester
* Language: English
* Lectures schedule: Wednesday 14-16 (Lab I) and Friday 11-13 (C1).
* Question time: After lectures or by appointment
* [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cpc1718) to discuss solutions

## Goals and opportunities
The goal of the course is to improve programming and problem solving skills of the students by facing them with difficult problems and by presenting the techniques that help their reasoning in the implementation of correct and efficient solutions.
The importance of these skills has been recognized by the most important software companies worldwide, which evaluate candidates in their job interviews mostly by the ability in addressing such difficult problems (e.g., see [here](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/company-preparation/)).

A natural goal is to involve the students in the intellectual pleasure of programming and problem solving, also preparing them for the most important international online contests, such as [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/), [Codeforces](Codeforces), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/), [Facebook Hacker Cup](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup/), [Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam/) and so on, for internships in most important companies and their interviews.
A desirable side-effect of the course could be to organize and prepare teams of students for online contests.

The course will provide the opportunity of
* facing with challenging algorithmic problems;
* improving problem solving and programming skills;
* getting in touch with some big companies for internships, scholarships, or thesis proposals.


## Exam
The exam consists of two parts: Homeworks 50% - Written/oral test 50%.

Extra points for
* active participation to our Google group
* serious participation to online contests, e.g., CodeForces, TopCoder, Hacker
Rank, Google Code Jam, ...
* successful interview with a big company

For full marks in the "Homeworks" part of the exam you must solve all the
problems.
I'll check your solutions by reading the code and their descriptions and by
submitting them to the problems' sites. I should be able to submit any solution
without any change.
**A solution that doesn't pass the tests (for any reason) will be considered
wrong!**

Please create a [github](http://github.com) repository to collect all your
solutions and their descriptions.
The repository can be either private or public. In both cases I should be able
to access it.
Please send me a link to your repository and keep the repository updated. I
should be able to monitor your progresses.

The quality of your code will be evaluated. As your style will improve a lot
with practice, I'll evaluate only the quality of the last submitted solutions.

### How to solve a problem

* Read carefully the description of the problem.
* Make sure you understand the problem by checking the examples.
* Design a first trivial solution.
* Think about a more efficient solution. The use of some running examples
usually helps a lot in finding a better solution.
If your are not able to find such solution, try to find some hints by
discussing with other students, by asking questions on the group, by looking at
the solution in our Web page, or by searching on internet. This is perfectly
fine for the first problems and for most difficult ones. In any case, make sure
you really understand the solution and the properties it is exploiting! Always
compare your solution with existing ones.
* Write a brief description of your solution in English. Provide an analysis of
its time and space complexity.
* Implement your own solution in C++.
* Submit your implementation to the problem's site. Fix it until it passes all
the tests.

## Background <a name="Background"></a>
If you wish to refresh your mind on basic Algorithms and Data Structures, I suggest you to look at the well-known book [Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition](http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11866) by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein.
